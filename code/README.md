Example of one of the figures in the manuscript (and generated by the code).

## Reproducibility

The main requirements to execute the code will be to have installed in your computing environment:

+ Python >=3.8
+ R >= 4.1.2
+ HYSPLIT 5.2.0

Instructions to reproduce the environment follow:

### Python

To ensure reproducibility of the Python environment, we use `poetry`, so the dependencies of the project are defined in the `pyproject.toml` file. Go to the `poetry` [docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to find out how to install it in your machine in case it's not there already. 

Then, clone this repo, go to the root folder, and run `poetry install`.
